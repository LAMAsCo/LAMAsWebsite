# Digital Gardening 101

The metaphor of "software architecture" implies that we are building rigid structures. Sketches turn into blueprints, blueprints turn into steel beams. Once the concrete is poured, changing the foundation requires jackhammers and destruction.

But software isn't concrete. It's code. It's organic. A better metaphor is **Gardening**.

## Pruning as Refactoring

In a garden, you don't just plant seeds and walk away. You water. You weed. And crucially, you **prune**.

Pruning can feel destructive. You are cutting away healthy branches using sharp shears. But any gardener knows that pruning is essential for growth. It directs energy to the most vital parts of the plant, improves airflow, and prevents disease.

In code, this is refactoring. Deleting code is often more valuable than writing it. Removing a legacy feature that only 1% of users touch allows your team to focus their energy on the core product.

## Permaculture Design

Permaculture is a design system that mimics nature. It focuses on:

1.  **Observing and Interacting**: Don't force a solution. Watch how users actually use your tool.
2.  **Catching and Storing Energy**: Cache expensive computations. Store user intent.
3.  **Obtaining a Yield**: Every feature should provide value.

## Growing Slowly

Gardens don't appear overnight. They grow in seasons. Similarly, great software evolves. Don't try to build the perfect cathedral in V1. Plant a seed. Nurture it. Let it grow.
