# Why LAMAs Exists and Why I’m Building PulseBoard

I wanted a place to think clearly in public, and a project that forced me to apply what I’m learning instead of just reading about it.

LAMAs is the writing.
PulseBoard is the work.

They exist to force me to execute and take action.

## The real goal

This isn’t about shipping something perfect or pretending I have everything figured out. My goal is to take more risks and break things. It’s about showing the full process, the decisions, the trade‑offs, and slowly build towards better skills, projects, and writing.

I learn faster when there’s friction and accountability. Building in public creates both.

The goals are simple:

* Build tools that are immediately useful.
* Get feedback early and improve fast.
* Do it in public.

## What PulseBoard is

PulseBoard is a lightweight uptime monitoring tool for apps, websites, and APIs.

It focuses on the basics done well:

* Automated health checks.
* Email alerts that are proactive without being noisy.
* Response time tracking and historical performance trends.
* Simple dashboards that tell you what’s broken and when.

Under the hood, it’s built with security and practicality in mind: Supabase, encrypted credentials, HTTPS everywhere, and row‑level security by default.

It’s intentionally simple. The goal isn’t to compete with enterprise platforms. It’s to give solo developers and small teams a clear signal when something goes wrong.

## What LAMAs is

LAMAs is my notebook, published.

It’s where I will write my thoughts, in short, direct pieces about:

* What I’m learning while building PulseBoard.
* Any tech related developments I find interesting.
* Design decisions, mistakes, and revisions.

Some posts will be rough. Some will be opinionated. All of them are meant to be useful, honest, and invite criticism.

## Why build this publicly

Because pressure creates clarity. I've built a lot in private through education and personal projects. 

Writing forces me to explain things clearly. Shipping publicly forces me to care about reliability and user experience. Feedback exposes blind spots I wouldn’t find on my own.

More importantly, collaboration only happens when there’s something real to react to.

## What’s coming next

Nothing flashy. Just steady improvement.

* Better control over settings and status pages in PulseBoard.
* More reliability features where they actually matter.
* Essays on the progress, design, and engineering

If any of this resonates, follow along, send feedback, or try PulseBoard.

I’m here to learn fast, build useful things, and work with people who care about shipping.
