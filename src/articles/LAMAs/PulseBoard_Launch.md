# Why LAMAs Exists and Why I’m Building PulseBoard

These project achieve two things. LAMAs gives me a place I control to think clearly in public, and PulseBoard gives me a project that I'm accountable for. 

LAMAs is the writing part, and PulseBoard is the working part. They coexist intentionally.

I am no expert, and I am  a long way  off from ever being one,  but I want to ship stuff, learn quickly, and do so visibly. LAMAs will let me share the decisions that seem obvious, the weird tradeoffs, and the things that get broken before they are functional. 

## Why Do This at All

I, like many of you, learn much faster when there is friction and accountability. Public building is a way of creating both.

Writing is a process that makes me slow down and put my thoughts into words, while shipping makes me care about reliability and user experience. Together they transform vague ideas into something real.

LAMAs exists as a space to capture that thinking while it’s still forming.

## What PulseBoard Is

PulseBoard is a lightweight uptime monitoring tool for apps, websites, and APIs that focuses on the basics done well. Health checks run on a predictable cadence. Alerts are proactive but restrained. 

I'm now improving on dashboards to show clearly what’s broken, when it broke, and how long it stayed that way.

In the background, it is intentionally monotonous in the right ways. Supabase for authentication and data, encrypted passwords, HTTPS always on, and row-level security as a default. I have no shot at confronting the enterprise platforms, and I won't be able to keep up with their feature checklists. The goal is to become relevant to small teams who only want clarity when something goes wrong.

## What LAMAs Is For

Tools alone aren't the whole point. LAMAs is to learn and share as a published notebook.

It’s where I write down short, direct pieces about what I’m learning while building PulseBoard, along with wider thoughts on software, design decisions, and practical engineering. Some posts will be rough, others opinions, but the goal is to only share honest ideas.

## Why This Is Public

Doing this publicly is a forcing function.

Pressure creates clarity. Feedback exposes blind spots. Collaboration only happens when there’s something real for other people to react to.

This setup keeps me honest and moving forward.

## What Comes Next

Nothing showy. Just consistent enhancement.

PulseBoard will have improved dashboards, tighter account management, and reliability features that are indeed needed. LAMAs will keep on documenting the entire process: what was successful, what was not, and the reasons behind some of the choices.

If any of this is relatable, then give PulseBoard a try and leave your feedback. I am here to learn fast, create useful stuff, and to collaborate with the people who are interested in shipping.
